    <h2>Banners: A Practical Introduction</h2>
    <p>Despite Banners just being images that appear on the website's home page,
    there is actually quite a powerful system to manage these. The best way to
    talk you through is from the very start - creating a banner.</p>
    <p>To create a new Banner, click this link. If you've already done so or
    want to skip this step, click Next.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Campaign</h2>
    <p>So you've got your Banner uploaded, that's great. However, it is only
      live on the Website when there is an active <em>Campaign</em> associated
      with it. Click the View Campaigns link next to the Banner you want to
      configure to continue.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Banner</h2>
    <p>This page is pretty straight forward. Be aware that the Banner Title
    does appear website and will be picked up by screenreaders and search
    engines. When you're done, click Submit to move on.</p>

    <h2>Campaigns</h2>
    <p>In Banner terms, a Campaign is a set of instructions that tell the
    Website what days and times this Banner should be shown.
    <p>A Campaign consists of start and end dates, as well as timeslots. A
    Banner can have any number of Campaigns linked to it.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Campaign</h2>
    <p>To create a Campaign for this Banner, click the "Create a new Campaign"
    link.</p>
  </li>
  {% endif %}
  {% if action == 'createCampaign' %}
  <li data-id="bannercampaignfrm-effective_to">
    <h2>Effective Dates</h2>
    <p>The Start and End Times define when the Campaign first goes live and when
    it expires and is no longer shown. Go ahead and fill these in.</p>
  </li>
  <li data-id="bannercampaignfrm-location">
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>If you Website has more than one page which hosts Banners, you can tell
    it which one this Banner is for.</p>
  </li>
  <li data-id="bannercampaignfrm-timeslots">
    <h2>Timeslots</h2>
    <p>For more precise control over when the Banner is live, you can tell me
    what times and days of the week you want. For example, if you are
    advertising a Show that is on Thursday afternoons, you may want to do so on
    Wednesdays, but Friday morning does not make so much sense.</p>
    <p>If you don't fill anything in here, your Campaign is active but doesn't
    have any times to be displayed. These timeslots will also only work between
    the Start and End Times you filled in before.</p>
  </li>
  <li data-id="bannercampaignfrm-submit" data-button="_none">
    <h2>Create the Campaign</h2>
    <p>Go ahead and click Submit when you're ready.</p>

    <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
    <p>Your Banner has now been uploaded and a Campaign put on the Website.
    These changes happen straight away so if the Campaign is running now, go
    ahead and take a look! You can edit this Campaign at any time just by
    editing the information here and clicking Submit again.</p>

    <h2>Banner Admin Tips</h2>
    <p>Finally, here's some hints on how to make Banners work best.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The best way to remove a banner from the website quickly is to set the
      end time for all of its active Campaigns to the past.</li>
      <li>Make Banners suit your website and station branding - but still make
      it stand out from the rest of the page, as well as any other Banners that
      may be in rotation.</li>
      <li>Banners get boring fast. Keep them fresh and changing to keep the
      interest of your visitors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
