<h2>This does exactly what you think</h2>
<p>Activating the button below does exactly what it says on the tin. Once it is
    pressed, the following things will happen:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The station's currently scheduled output will be suspended</li>
    <li>The station will be locked to playing only the prepared emergency file</li>
    <li>A very large number of people will be contacted to inform them this has happened</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this has been activated, <strong>you will not be able to reverse this</strong>.
    Management, News and Technical will be summoned, who will investigate the situation
    and then decide if/when broadcasting can resume.</p>

<p>You should push this button if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The King or another named person has died, or you believe they have died</li>
    <li>Another major destructive event has occured (e.g. a terrorist attack, nuclear war)</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>should not</strong> push this button if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You just want to know what it does</li>
    <li>You think it's the zombie apocalypse (probably just HAZSoc again...)</li>
    <li>You don't think it's been tested for a while (talk to Comp/Eng: They have better ways to test it)</li>
    <li>You have run out of bacon</li>
</ul>
