MyRadio
=======

Hey! You've stumbled upon URY's web management system for all of its operations.
Internally called MyURY, this will be generalised and documented over the
coming months so that it will hopefully be usable for anyone wanting to start
their own community or student radio venture.

MyRadio is part of a suite of upcoming public projects, including:
- iTones, our liquidsoap sustainer system
- loggerng, our python audio logging and retriving system
- Bootstrapping scripts for setting up and configuring all the dependencies

Super Quickstart
----------------
MyRadio comes with a Vagrantfile based on Ubuntu 16.04.
If you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) installed and want to get
developing or playing right away, just run `vagrant up` and a few minutes
later [you'll have a working server](https://localhost:4443/myradio/).

During setup, you'll be asked for database credentials - you can use:
* Hostname: localhost
* Database: myradio
* Username: myradio
* Password: myradio

Note that the Vagrant bootstrap script gives the myradio user CREATEDB
permissions, so be sure to never run this in a production environment, or remove
the permission before doing so.

Quickstart
==========
Install Apache2, PHP, Composer and PostgreSQL on your prefered Unix-based
distro. Or Windows, if you're into that. MyRadio has been tested with Ubuntu and
FreeBSD.

cd to your MyRadio installation and run `composer install`

Edit your Apache config as follows (where /usr/local/www/myradio is your
checkout of this repository):

```
Alias /myradio /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/Public

<Directory /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/Public>
   Require all granted
   AllowOverride None
</Directory>

Alias /api /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/PublicAPI
<Directory /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/PublicAPI>
  Require all granted
  AllowOverride None
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^ /api/index.php [QSA,L]
</Directory>

```

Restart Apache2, go to http://hostname/myradio and follow the instructions.

For a new postgresql server, run the following after:
```
pg_createcluster [YOUR_POSTGRES_VERSION] myradio
su postgres
psql
CREATE USER myradio WITH password '[A_STRONG_PASSWORD]';
CREATE DATABASE myradio WITH OWNER=myradio;
```

Tests
-----
MyRadio uses [Codeception](http://codeception.com/quickstart) for its test
suite.

To run the tests, call `src/vendor/bin/codecept run` from the root directory.
By default this assumes that the API is running at http://localhost:7080/api/v2,
as per the Vagrant instance's defaults. It can also use port 80 for the tests,
by running the tests with `--env travis` appended to it.

A script at `./scripts/reset-db.sh` is provided that creates a Config file and
database structure such that the tests can be run (essentially just runs setup
for you). This script operates on the database directly, so needs to be ran on
the Vagrant instance rather than the host, if that's necesssary. The script
blanks the `myradio_test` database each time it is ran, so it can be used to
reset the database and config file, should this prove necessary.

Summary:
* `composer install`
* `vagrant up`
* `vagrant ssh -- /vagrant/scripts/reset-db.sh`
* `src/vendor/bin/codecept run`

The vagrant initialisation script also runs `composer install`, but that is run
on the virtual machine which also installs the PHP extensions required for
Codeception. These extensions may be missing locally, so running composer will
confirm that they are present.

Next steps
==========
Once you've got through the setup wizard, the next thing that's most useful to
you is most likely creating a show.

To do this, you first need to:
- Create a Term (Show Scheduler -> Manage Terms)
- Create a Show (List My Shows -> Create a Show)
- Apply for a Season of your new Show (List My Shows -> New Season)
- Schedule the Season (Shows Scheduler)

A note on Seasons and Terms
---------------------------
MyRadio splits Shows into "Seasons". Any Season is applied to in relation to a
"Term", which is a 10-week space of time. This is because The University of
York has 10 week terms, if you didn't know.
