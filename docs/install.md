# Installing Myradio

There are a few different ways to install myradio

## GitHub Codespaces

If you have access to the GitHub Codespaces beta (if you don't, [sign up here](https://github.com/features/codespaces/signup)),
MyRadio is pre-configured for it, which let you start a version of
Visual Studio Code running in the cloud, alongside a MyRadio instance.

To do this, go to [Codespaces](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/MyRadio/codespaces),
and hit New Codespace. After a minute or so you'll be dropped into a Visual Studio
Code window, running remotely on a GitHub server. Switch to the Ports tab on the bottom (or,
if it doesn't show up, press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and select `View: Toggle Ports`),
and click on the Local Address next to port 7080 to open a MyRadio browser tab. Then,
follow the Post-Installation steps below from Database onwards - the database hostname is `postgres` and
the database password is `myradio`.

To debug the code, press <kbd>F5</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and select `Start Debugging`.
You can place breakpoints anywhere in the PHP code by clicking to the left of the line number, and
execution will be paused when that line is reached.

The codespace includes Mailhog, which will trap any emails sent by MyRadio. To see them,
click the Local Address next to port 8025 in the Ports panel.

## Docker Install

If you have Docker on your system, use Docker Compose to set up an environment.
Simply run `docker compose up -d` and visit "https://localhost:4443/myradio/".

If you encounter an error with autoload.php:
find the id of your myradio container using `docker dontainer ls`
enter a bash session with `docker exec -it [myradioid] bash`
then in this session run `composer install`
finally exit the session by running `exit`

## Vagrant Install

MyRadio comes with a Vagrantfile based on Ubuntu 19.10.
If you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) installed and want to get
developing or playing right away, just run `vagrant up` and a few minutes
later [you'll have a working server](https://localhost:4443/myradio/).

When you're done run `vagrant halt` to end the process.

Make sure you have both "vagrant" and "virtualbox" installed and configured.
If this fail, try reinstalling virtualbox and THEN vagrant.

Note: The Vagrant bootstrap script gives the myradio user CREATEDB permissions
so be sure to never run this in a production environment, or remove the
permission before doing so.

## Uncontained Install

Install Apache2, PHP, Composer and PostgreSQL on your prefered Unix-based distro.
Or Windows, if you're into that.
MyRadio has been tested with Ubuntu and FreeBSD.

cd to your MyRadio installation and run `composer install`

Edit your Apache config as follows
(where /usr/local/www/myradio is your checkout of this repository):

```
Alias /myradio /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/Public

<Directory /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/Public>
   Require all granted
   AllowOverride None
</Directory>

Alias /api /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/PublicAPI
<Directory /usr/local/www/MyRadio/src/PublicAPI>
  Require all granted
  AllowOverride None
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^ /api/index.php [QSA,L]
</Directory>
```

Restart Apache2, go to http://hostname/myradio

To make a new postgresql server, run the following after:

```
pg_createcluster [YOUR_POSTGRES_VERSION] myradio
su postgres
psql
CREATE USER myradio WITH password '[A_STRONG_PASSWORD]';
CREATE DATABASE myradio WITH OWNER=myradio;
```

# Post-Installation

## Myradio Setup

CONNECT:

-   Open up "https://localhost:4443/myradio/" in a browser
-   [Use Chrome as this often fails to run on Firefox]
-   It will say "connection not private" so press "advanced" and then "proceed"

DATABASE:

-   On the intro screen press "Click here to continue"
-   Enter the database details (see Default Credentials) and press Next
-   Press "run task", wait a few seconds and then press "run task" again.
-   [This method is a workaround for a slight bug in how we build the database]

USER:

-   [Here you can make config changes but the defaults are autofilled]
-   Press "complete starting set", scroll and press "save and continue"
-   Input any first and last name, an email (NOT an @york.ac.uk email) and a password
-   [If you enter an @york.ac.uk email you will not be able to login at all]
-   Login using the email and password you just enterted

-   If you encounter an error you need to create the file /var/www/myradio/src/MyRadio_Config.local.php with the text from the "Show Config" button
-   [if you are using docker this needs to be done within the docker container using `docker exec -it [myradioid] bash`]

## Default Credentials

Database: (when building the database, these credentials are needed)

-   Hostname: `postgres` if running in Docker, `localhost` otherwise
-   Database: myradio
-   Username: myradio
-   Password: myradio

Vagrant VM: (if you need to ssh into the virtual machine)

-   Username: vagrant
-   Password: vagrant

## Tests

MyRadio uses [Codeception](http://codeception.com/quickstart) for its test suite.

[This was written with a Vagrant install in mind - has not been tested on Docker]

To run the tests, call `src/vendor/bin/codecept run` from the root directory.
By default this assumes that the API is running at http://localhost:7080/api/v2,
as per the Vagrant instance's defaults. It can also use port 80 for the tests,
by running the tests with `--env travis` appended to it.

A script at `./scripts/reset-db.sh` is provided that creates a Config file and
database structure such that the tests can be run (essentially just runs setup
for you). This script operates on the database directly, so needs to be ran on
the Vagrant instance rather than the host, if that's necesssary. The script
blanks the `myradio_test` database each time it is ran, so it can be used to
reset the database and config file, should this prove necessary.

Summary:

-   `composer install`
-   `vagrant up`
-   `vagrant ssh -- /vagrant/scripts/reset-db.sh`
-   `src/vendor/bin/codecept run`

The vagrant initialisation script also runs `composer install`, but that is run
on the virtual machine which also installs the PHP extensions required for
Codeception. These extensions may be missing locally, so running composer will
confirm that they are present.

## Next Steps

Once you've got through the setup wizard, the next thing that's most useful to
you is most likely creating a show.

To do this, you first need to:

-   Create a Term (Show Scheduler -> Manage Terms)
-   Create a Show (List My Shows -> Create a Show)
-   Apply for a Season of your new Show (List My Shows -> New Season)
-   Schedule the Season (Shows Scheduler)

### Setting up your own 2016-site

First pull [2016-site](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/2016-site)

#### database

Next you need a api_key to allow the website to access myradio's show information,

login into database with details used during setup of myradio

`INSERT INTO myury.api_key (key_string, description) VALUES ('ARANDOMSTRINGOFCHARACTERS', '2016-site development api key');`

`INSERT INTO myury.api_key_auth (key_string, typeid) VALUES ('ARANDOMSTRINGOFCHARACTERS', (SELECT typeid FROM l_action WHERE phpconstant = 'AUTH_APISUDO'));`

[please choose a better key than 'ARANDOMSTRINGOFCHARACTERS']

You might need add some other database columns to create shows

for example:

-   explict podcasts (to create shows)
-   selector (expected by 2016-site/can remove this from models/index.go 2016-site)

2016-site uses parts of database that aren't made on myradio creation,

#### finishing steps

This will fix shows not loading on 2016-site when using the base myradio database

After completing all these setups:

you can use setup guide in [2016-site](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/2016-site),
And setup a reverse proxy to "https://localhost:4443/api/v2" or configure ssl for https connections
To complete the setup.

### A note on Seasons and Terms

MyRadio splits Shows into "Seasons". Any Season is applied to in relation to a
"Term", which is a user defined space of time (normally 11-15 weeks). This is because The University of York has 12 week semesters, if you didn't know.
